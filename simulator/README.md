# Simulator

Easiest way to get webserial sim up and running was to just build a little serial project and go for it!
This is built with the [Pico-SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/external/pico_sdk_import.cmake) and meant to run
on a pi-pico.

## To build

I made this using the self-contianed self-downloading `pico_sdk_import.cmake` so all you need to do is

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

## To load to your Pico

### Using picotool (recommended)

After building, picotool will be available in the build directory. To load the UF2 file:

```shell
# From the build directory
./_deps/picotool-build/picotool load serial_echo.uf2

# Or if picotool is installed system-wide:
picotool load serial_echo.uf2
```

You must be in bootsel mode!

Other useful picotool commands:
```shell
# List connected Picos
picotool info

# Reboot the Pico
picotool reboot

# Reboot into BOOTSEL mode
picotool reboot -u

# Load and reboot
picotool load -f serial_echo.uf2

# Verify what's loaded
picotool info
```

You can also drag and drop the uf2 to the pico's startup filesystem.
